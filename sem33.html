    <h2><u>BCA-303: Object Oriented Programming using C++</u></h2>
    <p><b>Unit - I:</b><br>
        Object oriented programming concepts Why do we need object oriented.
        C++ Programming basics: Output using cout. Directives. Input with cin.
        Type bool, The setw manipulator, Type conversions.<br>
        <b>Unit - II:</b><br>
        Functions: Returning values from functions, Reference arguments, Overloaded function, Inline
        function, friend function, Static function, Default arguments, Returning by reference.<br>
        <b>Unit - III:</b><br>
        Object and Classes: Making sense of core object concepts (Encapsulation, Abstraction,
        Polymorphism, Classes, Messages Association, Interfaces) Implementation of class in C++, C++
        Objects as physical object, C++ object as data types, constructor, Object as function arguments,
        The default copy constructor, returning object from function, Structures and classes, Classes
        objects and memory static class data, Const and classes.<br>
        <b>Unit - IV:</b><br>
        Arrays and string arrays fundamentals, Arrays as class Member Data: Arrays of object, string,
        The standard C++ String class, Operator overloading: Overloading unary operations,
        Overloading binary operators, data conversion, pitfalls of operators overloading and conversion
        keywords. Explicit and Mutable.<br>
        <b>Unit - V:</b><br>
        Inheritance: Concept of inheritance, Derived class and based class, Derived class constructors
        member function, inheritance in the English distance class, class hierarchies, inheritance and
        graphics shapes, public and private inheritance, aggregation: Classes within classes, inheritance
        and program development, Virtual Function: Virtual Function<br>
        <b>Unit - VI:</b><br>
        Pointer: Addresses and pointers. The address of operator and pointer and arrays. Pointer and
        Faction pointer and C-types string. Memory management: New and Delete, pointers to objects,
        debugging pointers. Assignment and copy initialization, this pointer, dynamic type
        information. Streams and Files: Streams classes, Stream Errors, Disk File I/O with streams, file
        pointers, error handling in file I/O with member function, overloading the extraction and
        insertion operators, memory as a stream object, command line arguments and printer output.
        Templates and Exceptions: Function templates, Class templates Exceptions</p>
