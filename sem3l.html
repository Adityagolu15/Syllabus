        Input/ Output using cin/ cout. Decision making using if else, switch case, conditional operator
        Looping using while, do while and for. Array - single and multi dimension. Function - simple,
        recursive, call by value and reference, overloading, default argument value. Class - Constructor,
        Member Functions. Operator overloading. Friend function. Inheritance - Single, Multilevel,

        1. Simple C++ Programs to Implement Various Control Structures.
        Ex 1A: if .. else statement
        An electricity board charges the following rates to domestic users ti discourage large
        consumption of energy: FOR the first 100 units - 50P per unit, For next 200 units - 80P per unit
        Beyond 300 units - 90P per unit. All users are charged a minimum of Rs.50.00. if the total
        amount is more than Rs.300.00 then an additional surcharge of 15% is added.Write a C++
        program to read the names of users and number of units consumed and print out the charges
        with names
        Ex 1B: switch.. case statements and do .. while loop
        An election is contested by five candidates. The candidates are numbered 1 to 5 and a voting
        is done by marking the candidate number in a ballot paper. Write a C++ program to read the
        ballot and count the votes cast for each candidate using an array variable count. In case, a
        number read is outside the range 1 to 5 the ballot should be considered as a ‘spoilt ballot’,
        and the program should also count the number of spoilt ballots
        Ex 1C: for loop - Write a C++ program to print the different Pyramid structures
        Ex 1D: while loop Write a C++ program to print the Fibonacci series 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 …. By
        getting number of number to be displayed is given as input Eg. 5 is input value means it should
        print first 5 numbers 0 1 1 2 3:<br>
        2. Programs to Understand Structure & Unions.
        Ex 2A: Structure Create a Structure called employee with the following details as variables
        within it.
        1. Name of the employee, 2. Age, 3. Designation, 4. Salary
        Write a C++ program to create array of objects for the structure to access these and print the
        name, age, designation and salary
        Ex2B: Union Create a Union called student with the following details as variables within it.
        1. Name of the student, 2. Age, 3. Year of study, 4. Semester, 5. 5 different subject marks in
        array. Write a C++ program to create object for the union to access these and print the Name,
        age, year, semester and grade according to their percentage of marks scored. 90 % and above –
        S grade, 80% to 89% -- A grade, 70% to 79% -- B grade, 50% to 69% -- C grade 50% to 59% -- D
        grade, greater than 50% -- F grade<br>
        3. Programs to Understand Pointer Arithmetic.
        Ex 3: Write a C++ program to find the number of vowels present in the given character array
        using pointer arithmetic.<br>
        Ex 4A: Write a C++ program to print the given number in reverse order. Use functions with
        return type and without return type for reversing the number.
        Ex: given number is 2345 , output should be 5432
        Ex 4B: Write a C++ program to find the sum of factorial of a given number using recursive
        function<br>
        Ex 5: Write a C++ program to perform different arithmetic operation such as addition,
        subtraction, division,modulus and multiplication using inline function<br>
        6. Programs to Understand Different Function Call Mechanism.
        a. Call by reference and Call by value
        Ex 6: Write a C++ program to swap two number by both call by value and call by reference
        mechanism, using two functions swap_value() and swap_reference respectively , by getting the
        choice from the user and executing the user’s choice by switch-case.<br>
        7. Programs to Understand Storage Specifiers.
        Ex 7: Write a C++ program to demonstrate the static and non static variable usage defining
        them within a function.<br>
        8. Constructors & Destructors.
        Ex 8: Create a class for counting the number of objects created and destroyed within various
        block using constructor and destructors.<br>
        9. Use of “this” Pointer Using class
        Ex 9: Write a C++ program to create three objects for a class named pntr_obj with data
        members such as roll_no & name . Create a member function set_data() for setting the data
        values and print()member function to print which object has invoked it using ‘this’ pointer.<br>
        10. Programs to Implement Inheritance and Function Overriding.
        Ex 10A: Write a C++ program with different class related through multiple inheritance and
        demonstrate the use of different access specifiers by means of member variables and member
        functions.
        Ex 10B: Write a C++ program to explain virtual function (polymorphism) by creating a base class
        c_polygon which has virtual function area(). Two classes c_rectangle and c_traingle derived
        from c_polygon and they have area() to calculate and return the area of rectangle and triangle
        respectively.<br>
        11. Programs to Overload Unary & Binary Operators as Member Function & Non
        Member Function.
        Ex 11 A: Write a C++ program to count the number of persons inside a bank, by increasing
        count whenever a person enters a bank, using an increment(++) operator overloading function,
        and decrease the count whenever a person leaves the bank using a decrement(--) operator
        overloading function inside a class
        Ex 11 B: Write a C++ program to create two objects of a class called company and add their
        data members using an operator overloaded function for ‘+’ operator and ‘-‘operator<br>
        12. Programs to Understand Friend Function & Friend Class.
        a. Friendfunction
        b. Friendclass
        Ex 12 B: Write a program to accept the student detail such as name and 3 different marks by
        get_data() method and display the name and average of marks using display() method. Define a
        friend class for calculating the average of marks using the method marrk_avg().<br>
